# Write Code Faster
###### Updated: May 19, 2021


### Reuse Code Massively
Don't Repeat Yourself. Never rewrite from scratch a function/class multiple times. Always have a `shared object` file, or a library file containing useful functions/classes. 

> ___If you aren't reusing code, you're hurting yourself___ - Sean Barrett, Author of `libstb`

- [`libstb`](https://github.com/nothings/stb) A single-file public domain library with useful modules for C.
- [`lib-cpython-builtins`](https://github.com/midnqp/lib-cpython-builtins) Builtin functions of Python implemented in C.


### Master Your Code Editor & Keyboard
Programmers spend their most time of life with _his_ keyboard & editor. So make sure your editor isn't just GUI-based, and has many __quick key-bindings__. And worldwide average typing speed is 40 WPM. As a programmer, as an _author of the future_, you should at least have __70 WPM__. Most helpful when you write documentation for _the future_.


### Don't Comment Too Much
Comments can slow you down, and clutter your code. Rather structure & simplify your codebase. Name your classes, methods, functions, and variables better. 
> ___Let your code self-describe itself___    - Rob Pike, Creator of `Go` programming language.


### Consistency
Using many technologies for a single software, only creates inconsistency in long-term maintenance. Look at Google, they only use 8 programming languages for building everything.


### Search & Use The Right Tools
Specialize your tools at hand. Make use of libraries available. Did you know you can implement a http client in C++ by 10 lines? Use: `#include <boost/network/protocol/http/client.hpp>` 


### Avoid Bugs
Each bug costs you 20-30 minutes. Sometimes an hour, or a entire weekend. Instead of blazing through writing code and making opportunities for bugs - think & diagram your code well. Be habituated with good coding skills, by coding everyday.
