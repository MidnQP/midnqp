## I've been building...

`DarisOne` The one-stop merged-information StackOverFlow. One perfect answer to your question/topic with all you need to know. Built in Nodejs.

`alhamd-vanilla` Specifications for building hyper-performant & long-term-maintainable Node.js architectures.

`libavoidrepetition-c` Builtins of Python implemented in C. Blazing-fast performance with unsophisticated codebase now in C.

`alhamdjs` Tooling for alhamd-vanilla. Integrates with Node.js swiftly to eliminate the 'M' of the MVC architecture.
