## I've been building...
###### WEB
- **`DarisOne`** The one-stop merged-information StackOverFlow, built in Nodejs. One perfect answer to your question/topic with all you need to know.
- **`alhamd-js`** Tooling for alhamd-vanilla, to develop web infrastructures in a remarkably short amount of time. Totally eliminates the "Model" part of the MVC architecture.
- **`alhamd-vanilla`** Specifications for building hyper-performant & long-term-maintainable Node.js architectures.
- **`stessi`** Provided images containing texts, outputs audio of the text. Multiple languages are supported. Portable. Browser-based graphical user interface.

###### SYSTEMS (Linux)
- **`alhamd-linux`** A bootable operating system living upon a simple-most minimal layer over a minified compilation of the Linux kernel.
- **`lib-cpythonbuiltins`** Builtins of Python3.x implemented in C. Blazing-fast performance with unsophisticated codebase now in C.
- **`d-assist`** Commandline utility, which self-documents and parses args. For example, to execute frequently-used commands.
