## I've been building...

- **`DarisOne`** The one-stop merged-information StackOverFlow, built in Nodejs. One perfect answer to your question/topic with all you need to know.
- **`alhamd-vanilla`** Specifications for building hyper-performant & long-term-maintainable Node.js architectures.
- **`lib-cpythonbuiltins`** Builtins of Python3.x implemented in C. Blazing-fast performance with unsophisticated codebase now in C.
- **`alhamd-js`** Tooling for alhamd-vanilla, to develop web infrastructures in a remarkably short amount of time. Totally eliminates the "Model" part of the MVC architecture.
- **`alhamd-linux`** A bootable operating system living upon a simple-most minimal layer over a minified compilation of the Linux kernel.
