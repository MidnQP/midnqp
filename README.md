I am currently learning/collaborating to build the future of information processing, through _rapidly developed web infrastructures_.

## I've been building...

- `DarisOne` The one-stop merged-information StackOverFlow, built in Nodejs. One perfect answer to your question/topic with all you need to know.
- `alhamd-vanilla` Specifications for building hyper-performant & long-term-maintainable Node.js architectures.
- `libavoidrepetition-c` Builtins of Python implemented in C. Blazing-fast performance with unsophisticated codebase now in C.
- `alhamdjs` Tooling for alhamd-vanilla. Integrates with Node.js swiftly to eliminate the 'M' of the MVC architecture.
