Good day to you! I am Muhammad, a 👨‍💻 passionate software backend engineer focusing on Node.js and TypeScript. In my few years in the industry, I've improved my analytical thinking and collaboration skills. Now I know, we can reach Mars if we work in a team!

In my workplace, I develop large-scale 📦 backend applications, maintaining code quality & security best practices - while collaborating swiftly with the frontend team.

Previously, I was deeply invested in working with PHP and WordPress. In coming years, I'd love to pursue and further explore Golang and 💻 technical positions!
