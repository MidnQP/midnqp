# Never ever ever in your life use "xrandr".
# It's software-level. Even if you decrease
# brightness to lowest, has no effect
# at battery life!
sudo brightnessctl -l
sudo brightnessctl set 100 intel_backlight

ertb = estimated remaining time of battery (displayed on Ubuntu, running i3wm and nothing much else)

* Higher screen resolution slightly-increased/increased ertb
* Lower refresh rates slightly-increased/increased ertb

* Turning off backlit keyboard significantly-increased ertb

* Extremely low screen brightness (using xrandr) had little/not-noticeable effects
* Amount of whiteness/blackness on screen had little/not-noticeable effects




MORE THINGS TO TRY ON?
* Change brightness using some other software? Remember when I changed brightness from Gnome, then xrandr couldn't do anything?




FOUND OUT !!!
* xrandr, xgamma - are software-level
